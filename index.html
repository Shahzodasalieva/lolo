        From my point of view, autumn is the best time of the year and its not surprising. Most great poets were delighted with it and poetized its beauty and uniqueness in their works. Personally, I love autumn for its coolness which is like a breath of fresh air after boiling summer. I enjoy walking in the rain carrying a colorful umbrella and wearing a comfortable coat and rubber boots. Im really keen on having a walk through an autumn park or forest. They charm with their beauty of bright colors of leaves, sunshine is coming through them, and such a special smell of nature after rain.
